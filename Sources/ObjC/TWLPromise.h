/// A \c TWLPromise is an object that will eventually hold a value or an error, and can invoke
/// callbacks when that happens.
///
/// Example usage:
///
/// \code
///return [[TWLPromise<NSData*,NSError*> newOnContext:TWLContext.immediate withBlock:^(TWLResolver<NSData*,NSError*> * _Nonnull resolver) {
///    NSURLSessionDataTask *task = [NSURLSession.sharedSession dataTaskWithURL:url completionHandler:^(NSData *data, NSURLResponse *response, NSError *error) {
///        if (data) {
///            [resolver fulfillWithValue:data];
///        } else if ([error.domain isEqualToString:NSURLErrorDomain] && error.code == NSURLErrorCancelled) {
///            [resolver cancel];
///        } else {
///            [resolver rejectWithError:error];
///        }
///    }];
///    [resolver whenCancelRequestedOnContext:TWLContext.immediate handler:^(TWLResolver<NSData*,NSError*> * _Nonnull resolver) {
///        [task cancel];
///    ];
///    [task resume];
///}] map:^(NSData * _Nonnull data) {
///    UIImage *image = [UIImage imageWithData:data];
///    if (image) {
///        return image;
///    } else {
///        return [TWLPromise newRejectedWithError:[NSError errorWithDomain:LoadErrorDomain code:LoadErrorDataIsNotImage userInfo:nil]];

///}];
/// \endcode
///
/// Promises can also be cancelled. With a \c TWLPromise object you can invoke \c -requestCancel.
/// This is merely advisory; the promise does not have to actually implemented cancellation and may
/// resolve anyway. But if a promise does implement cancellation, it can then call
/// <tt>[resolver cancel]</tt>. Note that even if the promise supports cancellation, calling
/// \c -requestCancel on an unresolved promise does not guarantee that it will cancel, as the
/// promise may be in the process of resolving when that method is invoked. Make sure to use the
/// invalidation token support if you need to ensure your registered callbacks aren't invoked past a
/// certain point.
